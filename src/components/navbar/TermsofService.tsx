DIGITAL ASSET RISKS 5.1 Digital Assets: Digital asset prices are volatile and fluctuate day to day. Trading in these digital assets may be considered a high-risk activity. Proper diligence and sound judgement should be used in evaluating the risks associated with these activities. We do not solicit nor represent that digital assets are an investment vehicle. The decision to trade digital assets rests entirely on the users' independent judgement. Any digital asset may decrease in value or lose value due to various factors, including the discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, change to the nature or properties of a digital asset, or governmental or regulatory activity. Demand for digital assets may be partially or wholly driven by speculation or market sentiment. 5.2 Lack of Information available: You may not have full access to all the information relevant to the particular Digital Asset or its underlying platform or network. It may not be possible to obtain updated information regarding the progress or any changes to particular Digital Assets or their underlying platforms or network. Many Digital Asset issuers or operators may also have no operating history or track record that any be used to evaluate the ability to achieve their stated project goals. 5.3 Network Events: Digital Assets may be subject to various Network Events, including Forks, Airdrops, attacks on the security, integrity or operation of the networks, or Network Participants making a binding decision in relation to the network underlying a Digital Asset. Such events may affect the features, functions, operation, use or other properties of any Digital Asset, Network or platform. The events may also severely impact the price or value of any Digital Assets or even result in the shutdown of the network or platform associated with the Digital Asset. Such Network Events may be beyond the control of the User or {config.name}, or to the extent {config.name} has any ability to impact the Network Event, {config.name}'s decision or actions may not be in your interests. Where you transfer digital assets to {config.name} which are the subject of a Network Event, you may not be entitled to the proceeds arising from any Network Event, and {config.name} is entitled to keep any digital assets created because of Network Events (for example, in circumstances where there is a fork in the network). The User should not transfer assets to {config.name}, where you wish to receive the benefits of those Network Events. 5.4 Inflation Risk: Digital Assets may, either because of the inherent design of the digital asset or through Network Events, not be a fixed supply of assets. Where additional Digital Assets are created, the asset's price may decline due to the inflationary effects of adding additional Digital Assets to the total assets available. 5.5 Concentration Risk: At any point in time, one or more persons may directly or indirectly control significant portions of the total supply of any particular Digital Asset. Acting individually or in concert, these holders may have significant influence over the Digital Asset and may be able to influence or cause Network Events which may have a detrimental effect on the price, value or functionality of the Digital Assets. Network Participants may make decisions which may not be in the User's best interest as a holder of Digital Assets. 5.6 Suspensions of Trading/Network Events: Under certain conditions, liquidating a position in Digital Assets may be difficult or impossible. Certain Network Events (including total failure of a network) may occur rapidly and affect the ability of holders of Digital Assets to conduct transactions. Information relating to these Network Events may be difficult to ascertain ahead of time and may be subject to limited oversight by any third party capable of intervening to stabilise the network. 6. Cybersecurity Risks 6.1 Source code changes and flaws: The various source codes underlying Digital Assets and smart contracts are subject to change and may at any time contain one or more defects, weaknesses, inconsistencies, errors or bugs. Unless otherwise represented in writing by {config.name}, no audit or investigation has been conducted on any source code produced by parties other than {config.name}. 6.2 Cryptographic advancements: Developments in cryptographic technologies and techniques, including the advancement of artificial intelligence or quantum computing, pose security risks to all cryptography-based systems, including Digital Assets. Applying these technologies and techniques to Digital Assets or the {config.name} Portal and Services may result in theft, loss, disappearance, destruction, devaluation or other compromises of digital assets, the {config.name} Portal and Services or your data. 6.3 Reliance on the Internet: Digital Assets and the {config.name} Portal and Services rely heavily on the Internet. However, the public nature of the Internet means that either part of the Internet or the entire Internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given time. Further, interruption, delay, corruption or loss of data, the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of data, or the transmission of malware may occur when transmitting data via the Internet. The result of the above may be that your order is not executed according to your instructions or not at all at the desired time. 6.4 Unauthorised access: Unauthorised third parties may use the User wallet and effect transactions without your knowledge or authorisation, whether by obtaining control over another device or account used by the User or other methods. 6.5 Loss of Private Key(s): Losing control of your private key(s) may permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets. Neither {config.name} nor any other person will be able to retrieve or protect digital assets for which you hold the private key(s). If the private key(s) is lost, it may become impossible to transfer digital assets to any other address or wallet, and you are solely responsible for securing your private key(s) in a manner that meets the User security circumstances. 6.6 Operational Risk: Breakdowns or malfunctioning of essential systems and controls, including IT systems or Digital Asset networks, may generally affect digital assets' value. In particular, digital assets may suffer from a concentration of operational risk during development, including key personnel, governance and financial control risk. 7. LEGAL RISKS 7.1 Country Risk: If an investment is made in any Digital Assets issued by a party subject to foreign laws or transactions made on markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked to a domestic market, recovery of the sums invested and any profits or gains may be reduced, delayed or prevented by exchange controls, debt moratorium or other actions imposed by the government or other official bodies. Before you use any Product, you should be familiar with any rules or laws relevant to the Services. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected. You should obtain independent advice about the different types of redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade. If your country of residence imposes restrictions on Digital Assets, we may be required to discontinue your access to the Portal and Services. We may not be permitted to transfer Digital Assets held in the Products back to the User or permit the User to transfer Digital Assets out of the {config.name} Services to the User or others until the regulatory environment permits us to do so. 7.2 Taxation and required reporting to taxation authorities: You are responsible for all taxes in respect of any gains obtained in a Product, including past or retrospective taxes imposed on the Services. Before using any Product, you should understand the tax implications of acquiring, entering into, holding and disposing of a Digital Asset and a Product. Tax implications of any Service depend on the nature of your business activities and the Product in question. The User should consult their independent tax advisor to understand the relevant tax considerations. 7.3 Regulatory Uncertainty: The Services are potentially exposed to regulatory/legal risk. The legal and regulatory treatment of Digital Assets may change. Regulation of Digital Assets is unsettled and rapidly changing. Legal and regulatory treatment varies according to the jurisdiction. The effect of regulatory legal risk is that any Digital Asset may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to legal or regulatory change. This may affect the value or potential profit of a Product. Legal changes may make a previously acceptable investment illegal or subject to substantial restrictions that may affect the ability to liquidate a position. Changes to related issues such as taxation may occur and radically affect the value or profitability of a Digital Asset. Such risk is unpredictable and depends on geopolitical, economic, sovereign and other factors. Risks may be asymmetrical between established and emerging markets and affect some Digital Assets significantly more than others. {config.name} recommends that the User obtains independent legal, tax and financial advice and continues to monitor the legal and regulatory position in respect of its use of the Services. 7.4 Legal status of digital assets, Services and Portal: The laws of various jurisdictions may apply to Digital Assets or Services offered through the {config.name} Portal. Applying these laws and regulations to Digital Assets is largely untested, and laws and regulations are subject to change without prior notice to either {config.name} or the User. In particular, any current governmental or regulatory tolerance of Digital Assets may change rapidly, and Digital Assets may at any time be deemed to be a security, investment, asset or money by governmental authorities or regulators, which will affect {config.name}'s ability to offer the Services. As a result of regulation and legislation around Digital Assets, the Portal may not be available in certain jurisdictions or at all. Changes to access to the Portal or the Services may be made unilaterally on short or no notice to the User. {config.name} may receive formal or informal queries, notices, requests or warnings by governmental authorities and regulators. Governmental authorities and regulators may take action against {config.name}. As a result of such events, {config.name} may be required to discontinue the Portal or Services. The User may also be subject to governmental or regulatory action by holding Digital Assets or using the {config.name} Portal and Services. The User should take independent legal advice to evaluate the consequences of using the Services before accepting this Terms of Use or using the Services. 8. GENERAL RISKS 8.1 Suitability: You should decide to use any Service provided by {config.name} only after due and careful consideration. You should determine whether a Product is appropriate in light of your experience in similar transactions, your objectives in engaging with {config.name}, financial resources and other relevant circumstances. If you are unsure that the Product is suitable, you should obtain independent legal, tax or financial advice. 8.2 Fees: Before using the Services, the User should obtain details of all commissions, fees and other charges for which the User will be liable. 8.3 Not a Research Report: Any content provided by {config.name} does not purport to be, and is not intended to be, a "research report" or "investment research". 8.4 Commercial Arrangements: {config.name} may have a relationship with other entities which may not be disclosed to you. 9. PRIVACY Please refer to {config.name}'s privacy policy at https://{config.name}.finance/privacy for information about how {config.name} collects, stores, and processes information about the User. 10. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 10.1 Intellectual Property Rights Ownership: {config.name} owns all intellectual property and other rights in the Portal, together with their contents, including, but not limited to, software, text, images, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, and designs. Unless expressly authorised by {config.name}, the User may not copy, modify, adapt, rent, license, sell, publish, distribute, or otherwise permit any third party to access or use {config.name}'s Portal with its contents. Accessing or using {config.name}'s Portal or Services does not constitute a grant to you of any proprietary intellectual property or other rights in the Interface or its contents. 10.2 Trademarks: Any of {config.name}'s names, logos, and other marks used in the Portal or as a part of the Services, including {config.name}'s name and logo, are trademarks owned by {config.name}, its Affiliates or its applicable licensors. You may not copy, imitate or use such Trademarks without {config.name}'s (or the applicable licensor's) prior written consent. 11. CHANGES, SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION 11.1 Changes to Services: {config.name} may, in its sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to the User, modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, the Portal or the Services, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, as a result of a security incident. 11.2 No Liability: {config.name} will not be liable for any losses suffered by the User resulting from any modification to the Portal or any Services or from any suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access to all or any portion of {config.name}'s Portal or Services. 11.3 Survival: These Terms will survive any termination of your access to {config.name}'s Portal or Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should survive. 12. ELECTRONIC NOTICES The User consents to receive all communications, agreements, documents, receipts, notices, and disclosures electronically (collectively, our "Communications") that {config.name} provides in connection with these Terms or any Services. The User agrees that {config.name} may provide Communications to him by posting them on the Portal or by emailing them to the User at the email address provided in connection with the User's use of the Services if any. The User should maintain copies of {config.name}'s Communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. The User may also contact {config.name}'s support team to request additional electronic copies of Communications by filing a support request at julian@{config.name}.finance. 13. INDEMNIFICATION The User will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless {config.name}, its Affiliates, and its Affiliates' respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers and contractors (collectively, "Indemnified Parties") from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation, liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or relating to: (a) The User's use of, or conduct in connection with, the Portal or the Services; (b) Ethereum Blockchain assets associated with the User's Ethereum Address; (c) Any feedback or user content the User provides to the Portal if any; (d) The User's violation of these Terms; or (e) The User's infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If the User is obliged to indemnify any Indemnified Party, {config.name} (or, at its discretion, the applicable Indemnified Party) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether {config.name} wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms. 14.
